          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) technology is constantly evolving, with
              notable recent improvements in standalone headsets and perhaps
              most interestingly, mobile devices. Considering the potential of
              AR within gaming and interactive media, the importance of scaling
              down to more accessible lower cost interfaces is a vital topic of
              research. Mixing the digital and physical can result in immersive,
              unique experiences. With the standard of AR development tool-kits
              being so high it is easier than ever to release AR applications.
              Without the heavy costs of standalone headsets, mobile AR is
              making a splash in the industry.<br>These AR experiences change
              massively depending on the user’s environment. One of the goals
              of this project was how these differences in the user’s
              environment could be used to create unique and immersive experiences.
              <br>
              By using feature points within the environment, the environment
              can be reconstructed digitally, taking advantage of the user’s
              unique space. The user can then sculpt and interact with the
              resulting mesh in a similar way as VR solutions like Oculus
              Medium (2016), but with a lower barrier of entry.
              <br>
              Reconstruction of environments from tracked point data is a well
              researched area, but commercial solutions are generally limited
              to devices with specialised sensors such as the iPad pro and
              standalone AR headsets. This project aims to explore real-time
              meshing and reconstruction in Augmented Reality in a more
              accessible way which does not require specialised sensors but
              simply a mobile phone. I first elaborate on the relevant research
              into the respective fields, then define the project plan as well
              as the requirements of the system, and finally elaborate on the
              implementation and results of the AR mobile application.</p>
